          <h2>The Importance Of Windows</h2>
          <p>There is a significant impact of windows on the aesthetics of your building, both internally and externally. 
            They allow natural light to enter resulting in a bright and cosy atmosphere.
            Moreover, exquisite windows can improve the efficiency of your heating and cooling systems by allowing more sunlight to penetrate, thus reducing the need for artificial lighting and heating.</p>

                our Terms of and Conditions of Use and other disclosures and constitutes a legally binding agreement
                (“Agreement”) governing the terms being provided to you as a User with our service. Throughout this
                agreement, the words “Us,” “We,” “Our,” and “Company” refer to operating this site as is appropriate in
                the context of the use of the words. Likewise, the words “You”, “Your” and “User” refer to you as a
                User, the person who is being engaged with the website and presented with this document for your
                agreement.

                1.3 Accessing the Website, in any manner, whether automated or otherwise, constitutes use of the Website
                and your agreement to be bound by these Terms and Conditions. The Company reserve the right to change
                these Terms and Conditions or to impose new conditions on use of the Website. In case the Company will
                decide to change these Terms and Conditions, the Company will post the revised Terms on this website. By
                continuing to use the Website, the User accept and agree to be bound to the revised Terms and
                Conditions.

                2. Description of Service
                2.1 This Website offers information, advertisements, Surveys and/or other services as consideration for
                the provision of information to this Website. The Company’s surveys service is made available and
                presented to the User as a paid or organic advertisement or due to the User’s downloading, purchasing,
                subscribing, submitting to, or using an application, toolbar, browser extension, registration form or
                the like on the User’s computer or the User’s browser. The Company is not associated with or responsible
                for such applications or toolbars or browser extensions or registration forms or any technical issues
                with such Third-Party tools. Any questions, issues, problems, conflicts, or complaints regarding such
                Third-Party tools mentioned above should be resolved directly with the relevant Third Party.

                2.2 We do not sell or offer for sale any goods or services of any kind. Any such offers or sales of
                goods and services are conducted solely by third parties which we contract with to provide marketing
                services to. Once you’re visiting or engaging with our website, you may be redirected to a third-party
                marketing or advertising or service provider website, and at that point you will be communicating and/or
                transacting solely with this third party. Sometimes we frame third party advertiser’s website, and
                sometimes we host their content as well. For this service, we receive remuneration which is usually in
                the form of a commission or referral fee usually contingent upon you entering a transaction with the
                third party for goods or services. We do not ship any merchandise or provide any services to consumers
                or Users.

                2.3 By using the Website the User must comply with the terms and conditions set out in this agreement.
                The User must be at least 18 years of age (or meet the minimum legal age and any other requirements to
                enter into legal agreements in the User’s particular jurisdiction) to use the Company’s website. By
                using our website and by agreeing to these terms and conditions, the User warrants and represents that
                he or she is at least 18 years old of age.

                2.4 The Company adheres to best practices that the Website does not contain and will not contain any
                material that is discriminatory, abusive, or libelous or in any way inappropriate.

                3. Third Party Advertisers and Service Providers
                3.2 The Website may contain links to Third Party websites owned or operated by parties other than the

                3.3 The Company does not monitor or control Third Party resources or content or service outside the
                Website and therefore the Company won’t be responsible for any Third-Party content or service. The
                inclusion of links to Third Party resources does not imply any endorsement of the material in the
                Software or service.

                3.4 The Company does not control any Third-Party content or monitor it for compliance with any
                requirement (e.g. truthfulness, integrity, legality). Accordingly, the Company does not bear any
                liability arisen in connection with User’s access or use of the Third-Party content or service.

                3.5 Any dispute User has concerning to a transaction with a Third-Party, the user shall resolve the
                dispute with such Third-Party directly without involving the Company.

                3.6 The Company does not define, suggest, and execute any control over prices or exchange rates of Third
                Parties. The Company is not a counterparty to any deal concluded.

                3.7 The Company does not regulate services of Third Parties and has no opportunity to affect the process
                of providing these services and its results.

                4. Security
